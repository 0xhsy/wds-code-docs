# Introduction
Welcome to WELLDONE Wallet. Over the past month, we have developed a multi-purpose blockchain infrastructure wallet with a user-friendly interface. The result is an app that supports Cosmos, Ethereum, and EVMOS. You can access the WELLDONE project through the official landing page. And you can download and use our Multi-chain Wallet through the Chrome web store.

## What is the WELLDONE Wallet
* WELLDONE Wallet is a one-of-a-kind wallet for multi-chain assets. It is a multi-chain wallet that gives you control over all your coins from a single platform and your assets use just as you wish across different networks without restraints.
* Its two main functions are called
  * Universal Provider
  * KMS

### Universal Provider
* Universal Provider is our key mechanism that integrates Web 3.0 providers into a single standardized API. Our wallet facilitates injection across multiple networks through the Universal Provider, acting as a multi-chain integration tool for developers. This means our users can access and develop services for different protocols through a single provider which can save some valuable time.

### KMS
* KMS is our key function in a non-custodial wallet that does not require your private key. Only you (not even us) have access to all your assets which makes our wallet even more secure and safe for all our users. Safe yet extensive, our wallet is a one-of-a-kind crypto wallet that manages multi-chain assets with a single UX.

## What problem is WELLDONE Wallet trying to solve?
* While the Blockchain interchain ecosystem is growing rapidly, we felt there was still a notable lack of user-oriented infrastructure– this was our main motive for building our own wallet.
* As wallet compatibility varies by blockchain, users have to create numerous wallets to access different networks. Consequently, users can end up having to juggle a host of addresses and private keys. Developers also have to download, develop and test all the wallets they use.

## What's next for WELLDONE Wallet
* We created WELLDONE Wallet with three core objectives in mind. Creating a one-of-a-kind wallet for multi-chain assets, providing better infrastructure to lower barriers for developers, and developing a cross-chain bridge.
* By developing a one-of-a-kind wallet for multi-chain assets (KMS), we optimize your user experience.
* By building solid infrastructure (Universal Provider), we lower the barriers to entry for developers, so that more players can contribute to the ecosystem.
* Finally, by developing a cross-chain bridge, we can enable users to easily switch chains via their WELLDONE wallets. Rather than simply providing access to all assets in one wallet, we want to enable users to go seamlessly between various chains. So next up is our bridge! Join us, and together let’s bring your finest ideas to life.
