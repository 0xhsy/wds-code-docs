# Getting Started
Install the WELLDONE Wallet in the browser. You can download [Here](https://wds-code-docs.vercel.app/ko/docs/category/getting-started).

:::note
This guide assumes that you have an intermediate knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
:::

You must make sure that there is `window.dapp` available on the developer console once the WELLDONE Wallet is set up and operational. This is how your website and the WELLDONE Wallet communicate. More information is provided in the guide below.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
